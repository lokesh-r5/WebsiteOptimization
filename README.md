Important tasks I did to optimize the website

1. Changed querySelector to getElementById and querySelectorAll to getElementsByClassName to increase efficiency by using dynamic access.

2. Moved document.body above the loop to avoid browser rendering the page for everytime in loop to change pizza size and update positions.

3. Cached DOM elements by moving above the loop instead of querying everytime in loop.
